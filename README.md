## Troubleshooting and Learning Resources

While working on this project, I faced some challenges, especially when implementing the scoring system. Here's what helped me overcome those difficulties:

- **Seeking Resources:** I found [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) to be a valuable resource for learning JavaScript and web development concepts. Specifically, I referred to their tutorials on handling events and updating scores.


Remember that challenges are part of the learning process. Don't get discouraged â€“ keep practicing, seeking resources, and learning from your experiences.
